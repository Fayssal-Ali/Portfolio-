## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r table}



crosstable::crosstable(
 new_im1,
 AgeGroup,
  by=Mortality,
  total = "both",
  percent_pattern="{n}"
) %>%
  crosstable::as_flextable(
    keep_id = FALSE
  )

5/42 #0.11 odds of mortality given young age
21/57#0.36 odds of mortality given old age
.36/.11#3.27 = Relative Risk- 227% increase in risk of mortality given you age compared to old age
exp(1.46)#4.31 = Odds ratio of mortality given young age vs old age
```

```{r}
#BE Very Careful with setting factors in the correct order 
#Construct 2X2 table process
#First make separate dataframe
a <- data.frame(infect_mortality$AgeGroup, infect_mortality$Mortality)
#Factor the variables using he appropriate column names in dataframe
#Becareful with the order of the levels. Will matter depending on tables or model method
a$AgeGroup <- factor(a$infect_mortality.AgeGroup, levels= c("B","A"))
a$Mortality <- factor(a$infect_mortality.Mortality, levels= c("Yes","No"))
#Construct final 2X2 table for analysis
a <- table(a$AgeGroup, a$Mortality)
a
#Final checks
is.factor(a$AgeGroup)
#Epi analysis
epiR::epi.2by2(
  table(
    a$AgeGroup,
    a$Mortality
  )
)

#Attributable Risk = RD in percentage 0.24


```

#Hypothesis Testing using chisquare
#H0: There is no association between age and mortality
#H1: There is an association between age and mortality
```{r infect_mortality}
#chisquareTest
chisq.test(im_table, correct=FALSE)
qchisq(0.05, df=1, lower.tail = FALSE)


```
#Logistic Model 

```{r infect_mortality}
mort <- glm(Mortality~ AgeGroup, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = new_im1)
summary(mort)$coefficients

#mortality given young age
(exp(-2))/ (1 +(exp(-2)))#0.12
#Odds of mortality given young age
exp(-2) #=0.13

#Mortality given old age
(exp(-2.001+1.46)) / (1 + (exp(-2.001+1.46)))#0.367

#Odds ratio of mortality 
.36795/.11920

#Odds of mortality comparing age vs old age
exp(1.46)
#odds ratio of mortality comparing young and old age

#RD 0.249

#Confidence Intervals
confint.default(mort, level = 0.95)
#Wald CI
exp(confint.default(mort, level = 0.95))
```
-2.0 + 1.46x
Odds of mortality among the old group is 3 times than the young group
